            <h1>Interests</h1>
            <p>I’m deeply interested in Artificial Intelligence, Machine Learning, and Robotics, and how they shape the future of problem-solving and automation. I enjoy exploring how intelligent systems learn, make decisions, and interact with the real world. Beyond implementation, I’m curious about the ideas, logic, and design behind these technologies, and how they can be applied responsibly to build practical, impactful solutions.</p>
